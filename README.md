### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Shared Responsibility (Physical Security)
**Q:** Who secures the physical infrastructure in AWS Cloud?  
**A:** AWS is responsible for securing the physical infrastructure, and the company secures its data and applications within the cloud.  
**Explanation:** AWS handles data centers and hardware; customers handle data, apps, and access controls.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ AWS Global Infrastructure Benefits
**Q:** Which AWS Global Infrastructure benefits improve performance and reliability? *(Select TWO)*  
- **A:** Fault tolerance  
- **A:** High availability  
**Explanation:** AWS Regions and Availability Zones ensure apps stay online and resilient against failures.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Responsibility in Security
**Q:** What are the customer‚Äôs responsibilities in AWS? *(Select TWO)*  
- **A:** Managing operating system (OS) patches  
- **A:** Encrypting client-side data  
**Explanation:** Customers manage what‚Äôs *in* the cloud (OS, apps, data); AWS manages the cloud (hardware, data centers).

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Cloud Advantage for Cost Reduction
**Q:** Which cloud advantage helps lower operational costs?  
**A:** Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers.  
**Explanation:** Cloud eliminates the need to own and maintain physical infrastructure.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ EC2 Instance Type for Rendering
**Q:** Which EC2 instance type is best for visual effects rendering?  
**A:** Accelerated computing  
**Explanation:** GPU-based instances are ideal for high-performance tasks like simulations and rendering.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Compute Resource Provisioning
**Q:** How are compute resources managed in the cloud?  
**A:** Resources are provisioned based on demand, allowing for scaling and management.  
**Explanation:** Cloud resources scale automatically up or down to match workload needs.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Notification System for Bug Reports
**Q:** Which service should notify the team immediately when a new bug is reported?  
**A:** Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)  
**Explanation:** SNS sends instant notifications (email, SMS, or API) to subscribers.

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Function
**Q:** How does Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling work?  
**A:** Automatically adds or removes instances based on performance data and metrics.  
**Explanation:** Maintains performance and cost efficiency by scaling up or down automatically.

---

### üîü GUI Management Tool
**Q:** Which tool provides a graphical user interface to manage AWS services?  
**A:** AWS Management Console  
**Explanation:** A web-based GUI for creating, managing, and monitoring AWS resources.

### 11Ô∏è‚É£ Cost Optimization with Savings Plans & Spot
**Q:** How should a company combine EC2 Savings Plans and Spot Instances?  
**A:** Use Savings Plans for critical workloads and Spot Instances for jobs that are not time-sensitive.  
**Explanation:** Combine predictable-cost Savings Plans with low-cost Spot for flexible workloads.

---

### 12Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Tenancy Concept
**Q:** What does multi-tenancy mean in Amazon EC2?  
**A:** Multiple users share the same EC2 hardware while maintaining isolation.  
**Explanation:** AWS uses virtualization to securely share physical infrastructure among customers.

---

### 13Ô∏è‚É£ General Purpose Instance Reason
**Q:** Why choose general purpose EC2 instances for a web app?  
**A:** They provide a balanced mix of compute, memory, and networking at efficient cost.  
**Explanation:** Ideal for web servers, development environments, and small databases.

---

### 14Ô∏è‚É£ Loosely Coupled Architecture
**Q:** What happens if one component fails in a loosely coupled system?  
**A:** The system continues functioning as other components are independent.  
**Explanation:** Loosely coupled systems reduce dependency and increase fault tolerance.

---

### 15Ô∏è‚É£ Cost Optimization for Predictable Workloads
**Q:** Which option is best for 3-year predictable workloads?  
**A:** Reserved Instances  
**Explanation:** Long-term commitment offers deep discounts for steady-state workloads.
